# ubuntu-like-panel
This is a fork of the fthx GNOME extension. Add on Panel: transparent, straight, reduced height, non-bold fonts. Nothing more. The extension is compatible with GNOME versions 40 to 43 and has no external dependencies.

## Installation
Currently, the extension is not available on GNOME extensions. To install it, you need to **create a directory with the name of the UUID** (which can be found in metadata.json), place the extension files there, and then move the directory to **~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions**.

## License
This extension is released under the GPLv3 license.

## Credits
This extension is based on the work of the original fthx extension. Thanks to the fthx developers for creating such a great starting point for this fork.
